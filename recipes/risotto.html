    <h3>Risotto is a creamy Italian dish that tastes a lot like the rice version of mac and cheese</h3>
    <p>
        At its most basic, risotto is rice, broth and aromatics. 
        How you combine them will make or break the dish. 
        The trick to creating the perfect texture is warming your broth ahead of time. 
        Cold liquid not only makes the dish take longer to cook, but it can also cause the starches to seize up.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most recipes also include butter and cheese. 
        We’re totally on board with these additions because they’re delicious, 
        but they’re not strictly necessary. 
        All that creaminess is created by slowly coaxing out the rice’s starch molecules, so added dairy isn’t required. 
        You could easily make this a plant-based recipe by using vegetable broth and skipping the butter and cheese.
